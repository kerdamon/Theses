\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
The Purpose of this engineering project was to develop a system and tool to easily simulate the ecosystem and use it to conduct analysis of various scenarios.

Ecosystem consists of agents such as herbivorous or predatory species and elements like water or food objects. AI is relying on state machines and Machine Learning and agents are making decisions based on their needs and the surrounding environment. Agents also have a specific set of features that is inherited by offspring from their parents. 

The analysis covers the state of the ecosystem after a specified period of time, in particular the population and the distribution of the features of individuals participating in the simulation.
